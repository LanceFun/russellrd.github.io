  <h2>October 16/1988</h2>
  <p><span class="two">4pm</span><br>
  Today was an eventful day, I heard a 15-year-old boy named Christopher found out his mother is still alive.  Christopher was told his mother had died two years ago by his father.  When Christopher went to find his book that was hidden by his father, he found many letters from his mother that were from after she ‘died’.  Christopher found out after reading the rest of the letters, that his mother has been living in London all this time he thought she was dead.  Christopher’s mother lives in an apartment with a guy named Roger.

  <p>Last April, Christopher had come to my house to ask if I knew who killed a dog named Wellington.  I had no idea what he was talking about, but I has remembered a dog had recently been killed on the lawn of Mrs. Shear’s house.  On this day, I saw Christopher hiding in the backyard, but I didn’t want to tell Mrs. Shears in case he was there for an important reason.  Rumors around the neighborhood say his father was the killer of the dog.  Christopher was so scared his father might harm him, he ran away to his mother’s house.  He started the three hour journey a day ago.  The police have reported Christopher has not made it to his mother’s house.  The police are currently trying to find Christopher and return him to his father.

  <p>I wanted to look around for Christopher because I thought it would make a good blog post.  My friend Bob texted me that he saw Christopher at 8 am on his way to work.  Christopher was hiding from a police officer who wanted to bring him back to his father.  Apparently, Christopher is carrying a rat named Toby in one of his pockets and a swiss army knife that can cut someone’s finger off in the other pocket.  Bob said he saw a man went over to see if Christopher was okay and ran away after Christopher pulled out his swiss army knife.  Therefore, I am will not be looking for Christopher for my own safety.</p>

  A police report just came in at 8pm that Christopher was found and will be living at his mother’s house right now.  A friend of mine named James, who is also a friend of Roger, said Roger didn’t seem happy when Christopher came and wanted Christopher to go back and live with his father.  Christopher got really scared and won’t let his father get anywhere close to him as he was a murderer.  Roger said he would let Christopher stay for a bit before he returns to his father.  James said Roger was thinking of living on his own if Christopher stayed for a while.

  <h2>September 2/1988</h2>
 <p><span class="two">6:30pm</span><br>
  I walked to Cora’s for breakfast this morning.  I thought I saw a flyer on the road for the new Star Wars movie.  When I got closer, I realized there was animals on the cover and it was called Star Wars The Last Animals.  I thought this was funny, so I picked it up and brought it home after my delicious breakfast.  I took a picture of it (image below).</p>
